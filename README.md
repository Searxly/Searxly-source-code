# Searxly

Searxly is a privacy-respecting native macOS browser built with SwiftUI and WebKit.  
**Core feature:** It runs a fully local, private SearXNG instance on *your own Mac* via Docker (one-click setup, no accounts, no telemetry).

**Current status (as of this build):**
- Local SearXNG (Docker) is the primary, fully supported private search experience.
- A self-custody Base L2 wallet (BIP-39/32, real EIP-1559 signing) is included in `Searxly/Wallet/`.
- On-device / local AI assistance lives in `Searxly/LocalAI/`.
- The ad-block engine and the VPN / WireGuard implementation are **not** included in this public source (see "What's omitted" below).

This repository contains source code for transparency, code review, and learning. It is **not** a downloadable or buildable application — see "What's omitted".

## What's in this repository

- Complete browser UI and logic (SwiftUI + WebKit)
- Local SearXNG Docker management and configuration handling (the hero feature — see `LocalSearxngManager.swift` and `LocalSearxng/`)
- Self-custody Base L2 wallet (`Searxly/Wallet/`) + crypto unit tests (`WalletCryptoTests/`)
- On-device / local AI assistance (`Searxly/LocalAI/`)
- Supporting infrastructure (persistence, privacy controls, tab hibernation, premium design tokens, etc.)

## What's omitted (intentionally private)

To keep this a source-for-review repository rather than a downloadable app, the following are excluded via `.gitignore` and are **not** part of the public tree:

- **App entry point** (`Searxly/App/SearxlyApp.swift`) — without it a clone won't build a runnable app.
- **Ad-block engine** (`Searxly/AdBlocker/`, filter lists, cosmetic configs).
- **VPN / WireGuard implementation** (`Searxly/VPN/`, `SearxlyWireGuardTunnel/`, and the VPN UI).
- **Build outputs / signed binaries** — no `.app` or `.dmg` is published in the repo.
- **Signing identity** — `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is blanked in the project; set your own to build.

The Xcode project still *references* these omitted files, so a fresh clone will show missing-file references and will not compile into a shippable app. This is intentional: it gives visibility into the surrounding implementation while official, code-signed releases go through proper distribution channels. The maintainer keeps the complete working copy privately.

## Current Feature Status

- **Local SearXNG**: Fully automatic. One-click in onboarding or Settings → Instances. Creates `~/searxng-local/`, injects a strong secret, deploys the premium Searxly theme, runs `docker compose`, and waits for the instance to be ready.
- **VPN**: The WireGuard implementation is omitted from this public source (see "What's omitted"). In maintainer builds it requires a paid Apple Developer membership + a provisioning profile with the `packet-tunnel-provider` capability.
- **Wallet**: A self-custody Base L2 wallet is included (`Searxly/Wallet/`). Keys never leave the device — the seed is encrypted in the macOS Keychain (AES-GCM + PBKDF2, device-only, never iCloud-synced).

## Local SearXNG Docker Requirements (User Side)

Users need Docker Desktop (or OrbStack / Colima) installed + the Docker CLI enabled in its General settings. The app guides them and can attempt to launch Docker Desktop for them.

The bundled `LocalSearxng/` folder (docker-compose + configs + premium theme) is copied at runtime into the user's home directory. A strong random `secret_key` is generated automatically — never committed.
