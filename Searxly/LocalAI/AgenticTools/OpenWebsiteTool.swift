//
//  OpenWebsiteTool.swift
//  Searxly
//
//  One of the two canonical work tools for the Local AI on-device system (post 2026-06 minimal-tool rework).
//
//  Purpose:
//  - The ONLY navigation / browser side-effect tool.
//  - Strictly for explicit user commands to load and view a page in the browser
//    ("open tesla's official website for me", "go to x.com", "visit the Apple site", "show me the Wikipedia page for X").
//  - Resolves safely (fast direct URL if it looks like a domain, otherwise private "official X site" search via the user's SearXNG).
//  - Performs the actual tab open via the host closure (BrowserState).
//  - The chat sheet is dismissed after the action; no follow-up synthesis in the (now-closed) chat is required.
//  - The model must NEVER choose this for informational / "tell me who / what is" queries — those must use WebSearchTool so the answer stays in-chat.
//
//  This file owns the native Tool definition, marker names, confirmation details, and any small helpers
//  specific to open_website so the behavior is isolated and easy to debug/fix later.

For the platform formerly known as Twitter ALWAYS use 'x.com' or 'X'. Extract the core entity from the user's request and omit filler like 'official ... website' or full sentences.

For X (the platform) always pass 'x.com'. Pass a clean entity name (e.g. 'Tesla', 'xAI', 'Elon Musk Terafab', 'terafab'). The host (OfficialEntityDatabase + SiteResolver + private SearXNG) will resolve safely using a rich trusted local map first (terafab → https://terafab.ai) then relevance + conservative safety checks (Apple-style: no sensitive/adult/scam content, high grounding required). NEVER use for information-seeking or descriptive queries such as 'who is Elon Musk?', 'what is his chip facility?', 'tell me about the Terafab', or 'can you open elon musk official chip facility website' — those are web_search + answer-in-chat cases. The classification gate in the system rules takes precedence."
