//
//  WebSearchTool.swift
//  Searxly
//
//  One of the two canonical work tools for the Local AI on-device system (post 2026-06 minimal-tool rework).
//
//  Purpose:
//  - The ONLY research / information tool.
//  - For any "who is", "tell me about", facts, current events, people, companies, science, tech, "what is X?" etc.
//  - Always routes exclusively through the user's private/local SearXNG instance(s).
//  - Results are returned so the model (or follow-up generation) can synthesize a natural, grounded answer **inside the chat**.
//  - Never used for navigation / "open the page" intents (those go to OpenWebsiteTool only).
//
//  This file owns everything specific to web_search so bugs, prompt tweaks, formatting, and the native Tool
//  definition can be worked on in isolation.

Never uses public instances. You will receive titles + URLs + short snippets — read them and synthesize a direct, natural, to-the-point answer **in the chat**. Do NOT use numbers, [1], [N], citations, or a sources list. Just give the answer using the info.
